# AutoIdentificationProcess

AIP is a system used for enabling AIP Admin to see a list of defaulters for a bank i.e. users who have borrowed money from the bank but failed to repay it in their specified 
duration of time. The bank wants to maintain this list so that they can easily identify the defaulters list and can take proper measures to get back their loan. A Bank will have 
three types of defaulters Auto Weaver, Validate Error and Auto.
